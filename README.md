# leetcode
any coding practice problems actually, but default (direct difficulty subdirectories) is leetcode.

code-reviewed means I spent time reviewing and improving the code after initially trying to solve the problem w/ time constraints, e.g. [Flood Fill](https://github.com/momothain/leetcode/blob/bf5a4ac2258e09c504a582ee8a644b86d66682d8/code-reviewed/EASY_733_flood_fill.py)
