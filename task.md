Yes — I can read the problem description from your screenshot. Here’s a clean summary of it:

### **Counting Bits**

**Task:**
Given an integer `n`, determine:

1. How many **1-bits** are present in its binary representation?
2. What are the positions of each **1-bit**, listed in ascending order?

---

**Example:**

For `n = 37`, the binary representation is:

```
Binary:   1 0 0 1 0 1
Location: 1 2 3 4 5 6
```

* There are 3 ones (`1`s).
* They appear at positions **1, 4, and 6**.

So the result should include the number of ones followed by their positions.

---

**Notes:**

* The **leftmost 1-bit** is always considered **position 1**.
* Preceding zeros are ignored when determining positions.

---

**Function Description:**

Implement:

```python
def getOneBits(n: int) -> List[int]:
    pass
```

**Parameter:**

* `n`: an integer

**Returns:**

* An integer array `results[]` where:

  * `results[0]` = number of `1`s
  * `results[1:]` = positions of all `1`s in ascending order
